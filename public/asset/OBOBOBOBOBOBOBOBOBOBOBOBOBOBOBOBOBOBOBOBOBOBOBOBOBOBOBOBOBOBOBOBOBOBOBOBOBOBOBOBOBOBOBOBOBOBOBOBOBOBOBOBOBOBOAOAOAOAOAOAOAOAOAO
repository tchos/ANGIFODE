[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mTree[24m is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth indented listing of files, which is  col‚Äê
       orized  ala  [4mdircolors[24m if the [1mLS_COLORS [22menvironment variable is set and output is to tty.  With no arguments,
       [4mtree[24m lists the files in the current directory.  When directory arguments are given, [4mtree[24m lists all the  files
       and/or  directories found in the given directories each in turn.  Upon completion of listing all files/direc‚Äê
       tories found, [4mtree[24m returns the total number of files and/or directories listed.

       By default, when a symbolic link is encountered, the path that the symbolic link refers to is  printed  after
       the name of the link in the format:

           name -> real-path

       If  the  `[1m-l[22m'  option is given and the symbolic link refers to an actual directory, then [4mtree[24m will follow the
       path of the symbolic link as if it were a real directory.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [4mTree[24m understands the following command line switches:

[1mLISTING OPTIONS[0m
       [1m-a     [22mAll files are printed.  By default tree does not print hidden files (those beginning with a dot  `.').
              In  no event does tree print the file system constructs `.' (current directory) and `..' (previous di‚Äê
              rectory).

       [1m-d     [22mList directories only.

       [1m-l     [22mFollows symbolic links if they point to directories, as if they were directories. Symbolic links  that
              will result in recursion are avoided when detected.

       [1m-f     [22mPrints the full path prefix for each file.

       [1m-x     [22mStay on the current file-system only.  Ala [1mfind [4m[22m-xdev[24m[1m.[0m

       [1m-L [4m[22mlevel[0m
              Max display depth of the directory tree.

       [1m-R     [22mRecursively  cross  down  the tree each [4mlevel[24m directories (see [1m-L [22moption), and at each of them execute
              [1mtree [22magain adding `-o 00Tree.html' as a new option.

       [1m-P [4m[22mpattern[0m
              List only those files that match the wild-card [4mpattern[24m.  You may have multiple -P options.  Note:  you
              must  use  the  [4m-a[24m  option  to also consider those files beginning with a dot `.' for matching.  Valid
              wildcard operators are `*' (any zero or more characters), `**` (any zero or more characters as well as
              null  /'s,  i.e. /**/ may match a single /), `?' (any single character), `[...]' (any single character
              listed between brackets (optional - (dash) for character range may be used: ex: [A-Z]),  and  `[^...]'
              (any  single  character not listed in brackets) and `|' separates alternate patterns. A '/' at the end
              of the pattern matches directories, but not files.

       [1m-I [4m[22mpattern[0m
              Do not list those files that match the wild-card [4mpattern[24m.  You may have multiple -I options.   See  [4m-P[0m
              above for information on wildcard patterns.

       [1m--gitignore[0m
              Uses  git  [1m.gitignore  [22mfiles  for filtering files and directories.  Also uses [1m$GIT_DIR/info/exclude [22mif
              present.

       [1m--ignore-case[0m
              If a match pattern is specified by the [1m-P [22mor [1m-I [22moption, this will cause the pattern to  match  without
              regards to the case of each letter.

       [1m--matchdirs[0m
              If  a match pattern is specified by the [1m-P [22moption, this will cause the pattern to be applied to direc‚Äê
              tory names (in addition to filenames).  In the event of a match on the  directory  name,  matching  is
              disabled  for  the  directory's  contents. If the [1m--prune [22moption is used, empty folders that match the
              pattern will not be pruned.

       [1m--metafirst[0m
              Print the meta-data information at the beginning of the line rather than after the indentation lines.

       [1m--prune[0m
              Makes tree prune empty directories from the output, useful when used in conjunction  with  [1m-P  [22mor  [1m-I[22m.
              See [1mBUGS AND NOTES [22mbelow for more information on this option.

       [1m--info [22mPrints  file  comments found in .info files.  See [1m.INFO FILES [22mbelow for more information on the format
              of .info files.

       [1m--noreport[0m
              Omits printing of the file and directory report at the end of the tree listing.

       [1m--charset [4m[22mcharset[0m
              Set the character set to use when outputting HTML and for line drawing.

       [1m--filelimit [4m[22m#[0m
              Do not descend directories that contain more than [4m#[24m entries.

       [1m--timefmt [4m[22mformat[0m
              Prints (implies -D) and formats the date according to the format string  which  uses  the  [1mstrftime[22m(3)
              syntax.

       [1m-o [4m[22mfilename[0m
              Send output to [4mfilename[24m.

[1mFILE OPTIONS[0m
       [1m-q     [22mPrint non-printable characters in filenames as question marks instead of the default.

       [1m-N     [22mPrint non-printable characters as is instead of as escaped octal numbers.

       [1m-Q     [22mQuote the names of files in double quotes.

       [1m-p     [22mPrint the file type and permissions for each file (as per ls -l).

       [1m-u     [22mPrint the username, or UID # if no username is available, of the file.

       [1m-g     [22mPrint the group name, or GID # if no group name is available, of the file.

       [1m-s     [22mPrint the size of each file in bytes along with the name.

       [1m-h     [22mPrint  the  size of each file but in a more human readable way, e.g. appending a size letter for kilo‚Äê
              bytes (K), megabytes (M), gigabytes (G), terabytes (T), petabytes (P) and exabytes (E).

       [1m--si   [22mLike [1m-h [22mbut use SI units (powers of 1000) instead.

       [1m--du   [22mFor each directory report its size as the accumulation of sizes of all its files  and  sub-directories
              (and  their files, and so on).  The total amount of used space is also given in the final report (like
              the 'du -c' command.) This option requires tree to read the entire directory tree before emitting  it,
              see [1mBUGS AND NOTES [22mbelow.  Implies [1m-s[22m.

       [1m-D     [22mPrint  the  date  of  the last modification time or if [1m-c [22mis used, the last status change time for the
              file listed.

       [1m-F     [22mAppend a `/' for directories, a `=' for socket files, a `*' for executable files, a `>' for doors (So‚Äê
              laris) and a `|' for FIFO's, as per ls -F

       [1m--inodes[0m
              Prints the inode number of the file or directory

       [1m--device[0m
              Prints the device number to which the file or directory belongs

[1mSORTING OPTIONS[0m
       [1m-v     [22mSort the output by version.

       [1m-t     [22mSort the output by last modification time instead of alphabetically.

       [1m-c     [22mSort  the output by last status change instead of alphabetically.  Modifies the [1m-D [22moption (if used) to
              print the last status change instead of modification time.

       [1m-U     [22mDo not sort.  Lists files in directory order. Disables [1m--dirsfirst[22m.

       [1m-r     [22mSort the output in reverse order.  This is a meta-sort that alter the above  sorts.   This  option  is
              disabled when [1m-U [22mis used.

       [1m--dirsfirst[0m
              List  directories  before files. This is a meta-sort that alters the above sorts.  This option is dis‚Äê
              abled when [1m-U [22mis used.

       [1m--filesfirst[0m
              List files before directories. This is a meta-sort that alters the above sorts.  This option  is  dis‚Äê
              abled when [1m-U [22mis used.

       [1m--sort[22m[[1m=[22m][4mtype[0m
              Sort the output by [4mtype[24m instead of name. Possible values are: [1mctime [22m([1m-c[22m), [1mmtime [22m([1m-t), size[22m, or [1mversion[0m
              ([1m-v).[0m

[1mGRAPHICS OPTIONS[0m
       [1m-i     [22mMakes tree not print the indentation lines, useful when used in conjunction with the [1m-f [22moption.   Also
              removes as much whitespace as possible when used with the [1m-J [22mor [1m-x [22moptions.

       [1m-A     [22mTurn on ANSI line graphics hack when printing the indentation lines.

       [1m-S     [22mTurn  on  CP437 line graphics (useful when using Linux console mode fonts). This option is now equiva‚Äê
              lent to `--charset=IBM437' and may eventually be depreciated.

       [1m-n     [22mTurn colorization off always, over-ridden by  the  [1m-C  [22moption,  however  overrides  CLICOLOR_FORCE  if
              present.

       [1m-C     [22mTurn colorization on always, using built-in color defaults if the LS_COLORS or TREE_COLORS environment
              variables are not set.  Useful to colorize output to a pipe.

[1mXML/JSON/HTML OPTIONS[0m
       [1m-X     [22mTurn on XML output. Outputs the directory tree as an XML formatted file.

       [1m-J     [22mTurn on JSON output. Outputs the directory tree as a JSON formatted array.

       [1m-H [4m[22mbaseHREF[0m
              Turn on HTML output, including HTTP references. Useful for ftp sites.  [4mbaseHREF[24m gives the base ftp lo‚Äê
              cation  when  using  HTML output. That is, the local directory may be `/local/ftp/pub', but it must be
              referenced as `ftp://hostname.organization.domain/pub' ([4mbaseHREF[24m should  be  `ftp://hostname.organiza‚Äê
              tion.domain').  Hint: don't use ANSI lines with this option, and don't give more than one directory in
              the directory list. If you wish to use colors via CSS style-sheet, use the -C option  in  addition  to
              this option to force color output.

       [1m-T [4m[22mtitle[0m
              Sets the title and H1 header string in HTML output mode.

       [1m--nolinks[0m
              Turns off hyperlinks in HTML output.

[1mINPUT OPTIONS[0m
       [1m--fromfile  [22mReads a directory listing from a file rather than the file-system.  Paths provided on the command
       line are files to read from rather than directories to search.  The dot (.)  directory  indicates  that  tree
       should  read  paths from standard input. NOTE: this is only suitable for reading the output of a program such
       as find, not 'tree -fi' as symlinks cannot (at least as yet) be distinguished from files that simply  contain
       ' -> ' as part of the filename.

[1mMISC OPTIONS[0m
       [1m--help [22mOutputs a verbose usage listing.

       [1m--version[0m
              Outputs the version of tree.

       [1m--     [22mOption processing terminator.  No further options will be processed after this.

[1m.INFO FILES[0m
       [1m.info  [22mfiles are similiar to .gitignore files, if a .info file is found while scanning a directory it is read
       and added to a stack of .info information. Each file is composed of comments (lines starting with hash  marks
       (#),)  or wild-card patterns which may match a file relative to the directory the .info file is found in.  If
       a file should match a pattern, the tab indented comment that follows the pattern is used as the file comment.
       A  comment  is  terminated  by a non-tab indented line. Multiple patterns, each to a line, may share the same
       comment.

[1mBUGS AND NOTES[0m
       Tree does not prune "empty" directories when the -P and -I options are used by default. Use the  --prune  op‚Äê
       tion.

       The  -h  and --si options round to the nearest whole number unlike the ls implementations which rounds up al‚Äê
       ways.

       Pruning files and directories with the -I, -P and --filelimit options will lead to  incorrect  file/directory
       count reports.

       The --prune and --du options cause tree to accumulate the entire tree in memory before emitting it. For large
       directory trees this can cause a significant delay in output and the use of large amounts of memory.

       The timefmt expansion buffer is limited to a ridiculously large  255  characters.   Output  of  time  strings
       longer than this will be undefined, but are guaranteed to not exceed 255 characters.

       XML/JSON trees are not colored, which is a bit of a shame.

       Probably more.

       As of version 2.0.0, in Linux, tree will attempt to automatically output a compact JSON tree on file descrip‚Äê
       tor 3 (what I call stddata,) if present and the environment variable STDDATA_FD is defined or set to a  posi‚Äê
       tive non-zero file descriptor value to use to output on.  It is hoped that some day a better Linux/Unix shell
       may take advantage of this feature, though BSON would probably be a better format for this.
